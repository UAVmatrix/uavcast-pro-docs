You dont need a modem for testing locally in your home network, a local wifi or ethernet connection will work just fine. As soon as you have configured everything and are ready to go flying, you need a modem, we recommend a HiLink (Plug and Play) type. If you want to control your drone manually during flight, we also recommend using a USB gamepad connected to Mission Planner joystick integration. See more info bellow. Flight Controllers \u00b6 All Mavlink based boards are supported (PX4, Ardupilot). The Ardupilot project is often adding support for other flight controllers. The full list of supported flight controllers can be viewed here http://ardupilot.org/plane/docs/common-autopilots.html . To mention some supported board: Pixhawk APMx Cube Matek Navio+ Navio2 Connection Methods \u00b6 There is two ways to connect the FC to Raspberry PI, either using USB (preferred) or GPIO There is no diffrence in performance but the USB connection is easier and more elegant. USB \u00b6 Connect a micro USB cable between the FC and RPI as shown in the picture bellow. USB cross-sectional Use a USB cable with large cross-sectional area to minimize the voltage drop supplied to Fligth Controller. GPIO \u00b6 Its very imporant to connect tx, rx and ground if you want to use GPIO, and not only tx & rx. Warning RPI cannot be powered by FC telem port. Make sure you use proper power source for rpi. Supported Raspberry Pi boards \u00b6 Pi0w PI 2 Pi 3 Pi 4 Pi0w Pi0w runs fine with UAVcast-Pro, however the CPU usage will be between 50 > 100%. Some functionalities has been disabled to reduce the CPU load! If you intend to use other programs with UAVcast-Pro then Pi3 or 4 version is recommended. Power supply \u00b6 It's important that Raspberry Pi gets voltage between 4.8 and 5.3v . If you use LTE modem, make sure you are not overloading the USB port per. design. Read the modem specification / datasheet and make sure the modem is not consuming more than MAX output defined in the table below. USB Camera If you use USB camera, make sure you include the camera consumption as well. https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/power/README.md Limited by PSU referes the value from the (Recommended PSU current capacity). Make sure you use a proper power supply that are able to deliver above this value. If you need to add external power, please see instructions bellow. This is one solution, where we attach the power directly to the USB +/- pins, and one wire to the RPI fuse. The latter will make sure RPI is booting automatically when powered. Note Make sure you connect the modem to correct USB port where external power supply is connected. Modem \u00b6 UAVcast uses modem manager and network manager to control the LTE connection.

HiLink or Stick modems Some Huawei USB modems have a mode called \"HiLink\" which provides for \"driverless\" installation on Windows, Macintosh and Linux computers. These modems usually have the HiLink logo marked on the outside, or have letter H in the model name. Example E3372H . All modems in the table above is HiLink! Stick modems is a regular modem where you need to send AT commands to establish a cell connection. UAVcast has all the connection stuff you need integrate a stick modem. HiLink Advantages The big advantages being that the connection time is very fast and hassle free. A HiLink modem uses a web browser to access the modem settings. It acts more or less like a plug and play modem, you don't need to configure any parameters in UAVcast-Pro or Raspberry Pi. HiLink Disadvantages Hilink modems does not support Port Forwarding out of the box. You certainly almost every-time need to flash new firmware to access the Port Forwarding menu in the modem web interface. However, if you use VPN connection then HiLink is a perfect choice as VPN does't not require any port forwarding. Camera \u00b6 There are several cameras that works with UAVcast-Pro, PiCam Logitech C920 Logitech C615 GoPro. ( Can be used with HDMI to CSI converter ). This allows users to record and view live stream simultaneously.

These modems usually have the HiLink logo marked on the outside, or have letter H in the model name. Example E3372H . All modems in the table above is HiLink! Stick modems is a regular modem where you need to send AT commands to establish a cell connection. UAVcast has all the connection stuff you need integrate a stick modem. HiLink Advantages The big advantages being that the connection time is very fast and hassle free. A HiLink modem uses a web browser to access the modem settings. It acts more or less like a plug and play modem, you don't need to configure any parameters in UAVcast-Pro or Raspberry Pi. HiLink Disadvantages Hilink modems does not support Port Forwarding out of the box. You certainly almost every-time need to flash new firmware to access the Port Forwarding menu in the modem web interface. However, if you use VPN connection then HiLink is a perfect choice as VPN does't not require any port forwarding.","title":"Recommended Huawei HiLink modems by Countries"},{"location":"hardware/#camera","text":"There are several cameras that works with UAVcast-Pro, PiCam Logitech C920 Logitech C615 GoPro.

UAVcast-Pro has three diffrent cameras pre-defined from the dropdown menu. However, if your camera is not listed then you can insert a custom pipline with the needed plugins to match your current camera model and type. You can also send a test video by inserting the pipeline below to UAVcast-Pro custom field section, nice way to check if everything is working without the camera itself. Remember to change the Destination address: gst-launch-1.0 videotestsrc ! x264enc ! video/x-h264, stream-format=byte-stream ! rtph264pay ! udpsink host=GCS_ADDRESS port=5600 Take a look at this page for pipeline examples http://wiki.oz9aec.net/index.php/Gstreamer_cheat_sheet UDP / TCP / HTTP protocol \u00b6 Default value: UDP UAVcast-Pro supports UDP, TCP and HTTP live in-browser viewer for PiCam , other cameras only support UDP at the moment.

Note: default port for video in QGC application is 5600 Here's the app in action Mac OS X \u00b6 The simplest way is to use brew.

Start camera in UAVcast-Pro and open MP or QGC Streaming over VPN may cause poor video quality in MP and QGC If you experience issues when streaming by VPN, such as pixalating frames or grey overlay then change the gstreamer source in Mission Planner HUD, with this pipeline: udpsrc port=5601 caps = \"application/x-rtp, media=video, clock-rate=90000, encoding-name=H264, payload=96\" ! rtpjitterbuffer ! rtph264depay ! avdec_h264 ! videoconvert ! video/x-raw,format=BGRA ! appsink name=outsink NOTE! Mission Planner always starts its default gstreamer pipeline and listen on default port 5600, when using the custom source above we need to use a diffrent port so it wont make any conflicts. In this example we use port 5601 . Remember set port 5601 in UAVcast-Pro as well! Solution #2 \u00b6 Download and install gstreamer for Windows . Open a new command-prompt window and navigate to the gstreamer bin folder, usually C:\\gstreamer\\1.0\\x86_64\\bin Start gstreamer For Windows/Ubuntu/Mac OS X: \u00b6 Paste this gstreamer command in the command-prompt(windows) or terminal (unix/mac) to start gstreamer. gst-launch-1.0 -v udpsrc port=5600 caps=\"application/x-rtp, media=(string)video, clock-rate=(int)90000, encoding-name=(string)H264\" ! rtpjitterbuffer ! rtph264depay ! avdec_h264 ! videoconvert ! autovideosink sync=false From now on, your computer will be waiting for the input stream from Raspberry PI.

Add your raspberry IP address (if you use Zerotier VPN, add ZT IP address) in the TCP Host input box. Press Start camera button.
