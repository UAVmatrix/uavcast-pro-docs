# Zerotier VPN

UAVmatrix has made an agreement with zerotier team allowing us to bundle UAVcast-Pro with their application for non-commercial customers. We also developed our own web interface on top of zerotier controller [https://uavnet.uavmatrix.com](https://uavnet.uavmatrix.com).

If you are unsure about your login credentials, please register at [https://uavmatrix.com/my-account/](https://uavmatrix.com/my-account/)
with the same email address used for UAVcast-Pro purchase and you will find the login details under "orders".

All new customers will get an account at uavnet.uavmatrix.com with same expire date as the UAVcast-Pro license.

Zerotier usage instruction are described in uavnet dashboard.
