Ensure both devices show as connected in [uavnet.uavmatrix.com](https://uavnet.uavmatrix.com)  
Both should have assigned ZeroTier managed IPs

## 7. Configure Ground Control Station

1. Navigate to Ground Control Station page in UAVcast-Pro
2. Configure streaming settings:
  - Destination IP: Your GCS computer's ZeroTier IP
  - Telemetry Port: 14550 (default)
  - Video Port: 5600 (default)

:::tip Default Ports
Mission Planner and QGroundControl are pre-configured for these ports when using UDP.

- **Linux**: `sudo ufw allow 14550/udp` and `sudo ufw allow 5600/udp`

## Verification

Your setup is complete when:
1. UAVcast-Pro shows connected status for Flight Controller
2. ZeroTier shows connected status
3. GCS receives telemetry data
4. Video stream is visible (if configured)

:::tip Troubleshooting
If connection issues occur:
1. Verify all ZeroTier connections are authorized
2. Check firewall settings
3. Confirm correct IP addresses are used
4. Verify port settings match on both ends
