!['Configuration'](../images/pages/Camera/config.jpg)

UAVcast-Pro uses the well known media-handling library gstreamer to proccess the video pipeline towards the Ground Control Station.
It supports PiCam, Logitech C615, Logitech C920 out of the box.

!!! info

    Remember to activate camera in Raspberry Config if you are using PiCam.

    `sudo raspi-config`
    ![raspi-config](../images/pages/Camera/raspi-config.png)

###Camera Type

- Options: `PiCam HTTP, PiCam TCP/UDP, C615, C920, Custom Pipeline`

Each camera uses different start code, also known as pipeline to be able to communicate or process the video source.
UAVcast-Pro has three diffrent cameras pre-defined from the dropdown menu. However, if your camera is not listed then you can insert a **custom pipline** with the [needed plugins](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/plugins.html) to match your current camera model and type.

You can also send a test video by inserting the pipeline below to UAVcast-Pro custom field section, nice way to check if everything is working without the camera itself.

Remember to change the Destination address:  
`gst-launch-1.0 videotestsrc ! x264enc ! video/x-h264, stream-format=byte-stream ! rtph264pay ! udpsink host=GCS_ADDRESS port=5600`

Take a look at this page for pipeline examples
[http://wiki.oz9aec.net/index.php/Gstreamer_cheat_sheet](http://wiki.oz9aec.net/index.php/Gstreamer_cheat_sheet)

###UDP / TCP / HTTP protocol

- Default value: `UDP`

UAVcast-Pro supports UDP, TCP and [HTTP live in-browser viewer for PiCam](/pages/camera/HTTP Videostream), other cameras only support UDP at the moment.
Multiple users may view live video using the HTTP protocol.

###GCS Destination

All destinations you have added in [Ground Control](../Ground-Control.md) page will be shown in the dropdown list.
It is only possible to select one destination for video.

###Video resolution

- Default value: `240p (320x240)`
- Options: `240p (320x240), 480p (720x480), 540p (960x540), HD (1280x720), Full HD (1920x1080)`

!!! tip

    If your broadband connection has a low transfer speed, then lower the resolution to get smooth video.

###Destination Port

- Default value: `5600`

Change the Video network port. **Mission Planner** and **QGroundControl** supports video in HUD by default on port 5600.

###Bitrate

- Default value: `2000000`

Change the Bitrate value.

!!! tip

    If your broadband connection has a low transfer speed, then lower the Bitrate to get smooth video.

    Example: `800000`

###Frames Pr.second

- Default value: `20`

Change the FPS value.

!!! tip

    If your broadband connection has a low transfer speed, then lower the FPS to get smooth video.

    Example: `8`

###Start Video Stream

To verify if camera will start properly, simply press the start button.
If any issues, press the Log button to reveal any problems.

##Receive **UDP** video (Windows / Mac / Linux / Android)

### Ubuntu

If you're going to stream to a Ubuntu PC, install the some packages locally beforehand.

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gstreamer1.0-tools gstreamer1.0-plugins-good gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad
```

### Android

- Download and install [QGroundControl](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mavlink.qgroundcontrol) for Android.

- Find IP address of your device in preferences. You'll need it in order to connect to the phone from your RPi.

- Run QGroundControl and it will automatically detect your vehicle.

_Note: default port for video in QGC application is 5600_

Here's the app in action
![capture](../images/pages/Camera/qgc.jpg)

### Mac OS X

The simplest way is to use brew. To install it run the following in your Mac terminal:

```bash
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
brew update
brew install gstreamer gst-libav gst-plugins-ugly gst-plugins-base gst-plugins-bad gst-plugins-good
```

### Windows

####Solution #1

Download and install [Mission Planner](http://ardupilot.org/planner/docs/mission-planner-installation.html) or [QGroundControl](http://qgroundcontrol.com/downloads/)
both applications supports **UDP** video by default on port 5600 without any extra configuration. Start camera in UAVcast-Pro and open MP or QGC

!!! warning "Streaming over VPN may cause poor video quality in MP and QGC"

    If you experience issues when streaming by VPN, such as **pixalating frames** or **grey overlay** then change the gstreamer source in Mission Planner HUD, with this pipeline:

    ```
    udpsrc port=5601 caps = "application/x-rtp, media=video, clock-rate=90000, encoding-name=H264, payload=96" ! rtpjitterbuffer ! rtph264depay ! avdec_h264 ! videoconvert ! video/x-raw,format=BGRA ! appsink name=outsink
    ```

    **NOTE!**

    Mission Planner always starts its default gstreamer pipeline and listen on default port 5600, when using the custom source above we need to use a diffrent port so it wont make any conflicts. In this example we use **port 5601**. Remember set port [5601](http://docs.uavmatrix.com/pages/Camera/#destination-port) in UAVcast-Pro as well!
    ![hud-source](../images/pages/Camera/hud-gstreamer.jpg)

####Solution #2

Download and install [gstreamer for Windows](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/pkg/windows/1.4.5/gstreamer-1.0-x86_64-1.4.5.msi).

Open a new command-prompt window and navigate to the gstreamer bin folder, usually `C:\gstreamer\1.0\x86_64\bin`

###Start gstreamer For Windows/Ubuntu/Mac OS X:

Paste this gstreamer command in the command-prompt(windows) or terminal (unix/mac) to start gstreamer.

```bash
gst-launch-1.0 -v udpsrc port=5600 caps="application/x-rtp, media=(string)video, clock-rate=(int)90000, encoding-name=(string)H264" ! rtpjitterbuffer ! rtph264depay ! avdec_h264 ! videoconvert ! autovideosink sync=false
```

From now on, your computer will be waiting for the input stream from Raspberry PI. Once it gets a stream, you'll see the real-time video from your drone. 

##**TCP** video (Windows / Mac / Linux)

Select TCP from the dropdown menu in UAVcast-Pro web interface. Add your raspberry IP address (if you use Zerotier VPN, add ZT IP address) in the **TCP Host** input box.

Press Start camera button.
You should see **_video started successfully_**

Install gstreamer for your operating system (see above section), then open a new command-prompt(windows) or terminal(unix/mac)

Paste this gstreamer command in the command-prompt(windows) or terminal (unix/mac) to start gstreamer.

!!! info

    Windows users needs to navigate to gstreamer folder before using the below gstreamer command.

You need to change the **PI_IP** to the same as you used for **TCP Host**

```bash
gst-launch-1.0 -v tcpclientsrc host=PI_IP port=5600 ! gdpdepay ! rtph264depay ! avdec_h264 ! videoconvert ! autovideosink sync=false
```

From now on, your computer will be connecting towards Raspberry PI. Once it gets a stream, you'll see the real-time video from your drone.

##Startup help files (Windows)
It's possible to save the gstreamer pipline to a .cmd file, then you can just double click the file and video will start automatically.

Download files below, then right click and select _edit_. Change the port number or path of gstreamer if necessary.
