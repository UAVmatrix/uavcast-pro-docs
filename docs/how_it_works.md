#How does it work?
uavcast is an application that provides an easier method for streaming mavlink (telemetry) data and video over a defined network.
It will connect to the Flight Controller using mavlink protocol and proxy these packages to a destination of your choice.

The behaviour is exaclty the same as when using regular telemetry module, there is no limitaion using uavcast.

uavcast will use the default network connection for streaming, and by using uavnet, the connection will also be secure.
Uavnet is a vpn built on the zerotier controller and provides secure peer to peer conectivity.

The application is hosted locally on your device, and there is no communication to a 3rd party!
