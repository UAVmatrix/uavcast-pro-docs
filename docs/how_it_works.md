#How does it work?
UAVcast-Pro is an application that provides an easier method for streaming mavlink (telemetry) data and video over a defined network.
It will connect to the Flight Controller using mavlink protocol and proxy these packages to a destination of your choice.

The behaviour is exaclty the same as when using regular telemetry module, there is no limitaion using UAVcast-Pro.

UAVcast-Pro will use the default network connection for streaming, and by using uavnet, the connection will also be secure.
Uavnet is a vpn built on the zerotier controller and provides secure peer to peer conectivity.

The application is hosted locally on your device, and there is no communication to a 3rd party!
